# F25-T01 Team Contract

### 1. Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others to get the team an A?

YES.
All members should try their best to work together on the project.

---

### 2. What will happen if someone does not follow through on a commitment (e.g., missing a deadline, not showing up to meetings)?

Firstly, we will try to communicate with each other to understand the reason and try to resolve it together or adjust workload assignment, ensuring project progress and quality.
If the issue cannot be solved by internal communication, we will contact the TA or instructor for further guidance.

---

### 3. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?

We expect 6 hours per week per person, including meetings, coding, and testing.

---

### 4. How will you use ESE5190’s Friday lab time when the teaching team is there to help you answer questions and succeed?

We intend to use the Friday Lab time to conduct hardware testing according to previously formulated test plans and to get valuable feedback from the teaching team.

---

### 5. What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?

We’ll first communicate within the team to understand the difficulty the member is facing.
If there’s no improvement, we’ll redistribute tasks and workload and report to the teaching team to ensure accountability and fairness in grading.

---

### 6. How will you deal with the different work habits of individual team members (e.g., some people like to get assignments done as early as possible; others want to work under the pressure of a deadline)?

We’ll set internal deadlines before the official ones, allowing for different working habits while maintaining steady progress.
